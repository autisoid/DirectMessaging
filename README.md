# DirectMessaging
We don't have a feature to directly message somebody in Sven Co-op. This server plugin implements such feature.
Usage: `/w or /whisper or /msg or /m <receiver> <message>` to send a private message to somebody.
`/r or /reply` - fast reply to somebody

# TODO list
- Implement SAMP-like /tell and /shout (thanks to frizzy for suggestion)
